# Welcome to Social Network Project ðŸ‘‹

This project summarizes my studies from July 2022 to April 2023

Here we have mini social network that is implemented using react, redux and other cutting-edge technologies. With this project, users can create an account, log in, and discover new connections by following other users. Also users can browse posts, like them, write and delete comments. This project uses api of backend written by my teacher while i implemented all the front end part

It is entirely my work. From the project's structure to the implementation of each feature, everything was done by myself from scratch. Of course, there were times when I used the internet for help, but there is no part of the code where I just sat down and copied it from someone else's video or project.
